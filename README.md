PC-Based Oscilloscope with Arduino
This project aims to create a low-cost and simple oscilloscope that can measure both AC and DC values up to 5 volts using an Arduino and a laptop. With this device, users can measure voltages of up to 5 volts, making it perfect for simple electronic projects.

How It Works
The PC-Based Oscilloscope is designed to be easy to use. The user connects the device to their laptop using a USB cable, and the software running on the laptop can then read the voltage measurements from the Arduino. The device can measure both AC and DC values up to 5 volts, making it a versatile tool for electronic hobbyists.

Parts List
The following components are required to build the PC-Based Oscilloscope:

Arduino Uno board
Breadboard
Ten male-male jumper wires
Two 1N4148 diodes
10K ohm resistor
Two red and black probes
Setup and Configuration
To set up the PC-Based Oscilloscope, the user must first connect the Arduino to their laptop using a USB cable. Then, the user must upload the code provided to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE. Finally, the user must connect the circuit components as shown in the wiring diagram provided.

Usage
Once the setup is complete, the user can start using the PC-Based Oscilloscope to measure voltage levels up to 5 volts. The software running on the laptop can display the voltage readings in real-time, making it easy to track changes over time.

Conclusion
With the PC-Based Oscilloscope, users can measure both AC and DC values with ease, making it a valuable tool for electronic hobbyists. The project is designed to be low-cost and easy to build, making it accessible to anyone interested in electronics. If you have any questions or concerns about this project, feel free to contact me.
